*Method to the Madness*

This contain my solutions to the exercises found in Structure and
Interpretation of Computer Programs Language, 2nd Edition [http://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/]

The solutions were written and tested using guile v2.0.11 [http://www.gnu.org/s/guile/]

The solutions are licensed under the GNU GPL version 3.

The code is organized by chapter and exercise number. For example, the
code for the solution to exercise 2.42 in chapter 2 is contained in
the file named ex2.42.scm in the ch2/ subdirectory.

The directory **additional_assignments** contains attempts to answer the addition problem
sets from:
https://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/psets/index.html

Finally, the directory **inst_manual** contains problems from the
Instructor's Manual.

The plan is to follow the class lecture (and readings) schedule as
laid out in:

http://community.schemewiki.org/?sicp-text-to-video-map

as well as:

http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-001-structure-and-interpretation-of-computer-programs-spring-2005/readings/

All chapter readings will be done before watching the videos.

This is a work-in-progress.

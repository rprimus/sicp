*Method to the Madness*

This contain my solutions to the exercises found in Structure and
Interpretation of Computer Programs Language, 2nd Edition [http://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/]

The solutions were written and tested using guile v2.0.11 [http://www.gnu.org/s/guile/]

The solutions are licensed under the GNU GPL version 3.

The code is organized by chapter and exercise number. For example, the
code for the solution to exercise 2.42 in chapter 2 is contained in
the file named ex2.42.scm in the ch2/ subdirectory.

The directory **additional_assignments** contains attempts to answer the addition problem
sets from:
https://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/psets/index.html

Finally, the directory **inst_manual** contains problems from the
Instructor's Manual.

The plan is to follow the class lecture (and readings) schedule as
laid out in:

http://community.schemewiki.org/?sicp-text-to-video-map

as well as:

http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-001-structure-and-interpretation-of-computer-programs-spring-2005/readings/

*Reading Plan*

The plan is to read the Instructor's Manual (for the relevant
sections covered by the video lecture) first (to get an overview of
the learning objectives for the section).

Next will be to read the relevant section for the video (eg video 1a
first).  Then re-read the section in the book - making any notes.


All chapter readings will be done before watching the videos.

*Problems*
After watching the video, a second pass through the required section
reading will be done.  At this point, the exercises will be
attempted - first the subsection exercises (followed by the
Instructor's Manual additional exercises (if any)).

When both videos has been completed,  the additional problem sets will
be attempted (again, if any are relevant).

This is a work-in-progress.
